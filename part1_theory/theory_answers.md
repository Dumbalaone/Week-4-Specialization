•	Include: Speed in writing boilerplate code, intelligent code suggestions, and reduced context switching.
•	Limitations: Dependency on internet, lack of deep code understanding, potential security or logic issues.
Q2: Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning (Bug Detection).
•	Supervised: Needs labeled bug data, more accurate for known issues.
•	Unsupervised: Useful for anomaly detection in logs/code patterns, but harder to interpret.
Q3: Bias Mitigation in Personalization
•	Include: Risk of reinforcing stereotypes, lack of diversity in data, unfair recommendations.
