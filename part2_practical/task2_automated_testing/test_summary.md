# Test Summary

This test automated login validation on a sample site using Selenium. Two scenarios were tested: valid and invalid login attempts. For the valid case, the username `student` and correct password led to a “Logged In Successfully” message. For the invalid case, an incorrect password showed the expected error message.

By using Selenium with Python, we eliminated the need for manual testing. With AI plugins (e.g., Copilot or Selenium Manager), much of the element-finding and code writing can be accelerated or suggested automatically. AI in testing allows dynamic test repair, auto-suggestion of missing test cases, and faster test maintenance. In a real-world DevOps pipeline, these tests would run after every deployment to ensure no login-related bugs are introduced.
