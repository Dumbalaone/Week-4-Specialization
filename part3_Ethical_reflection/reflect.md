# Ethical Reflection

In deploying the predictive model from Task 3, it's important to consider ethical concernsâ€”especially dataset bias and fairness. Although the breast cancer dataset appears objective, it can still carry biases. For instance, if the dataset underrepresents certain age groups, races, or patients from specific socioeconomic backgrounds, the model may generalize poorly for those groups. In a real-world resource allocation system, this could lead to unequal prioritization or diagnosis outcomes.

Biases like these can lead to unfair treatment, especially if the model is used to decide resource urgency (e.g., who gets diagnosed or treated first). If a company were to deploy this in practice, it could result in discrimination or unequal access to care.

To mitigate such risks, fairness tools like IBM AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) can be used. AIF360 provides bias detection metrics and mitigation algorithms. By applying these tools, developers can test if their models perform equally across demographic groups, and retrain or adjust them to be more equitable. Integrating these practices ensures that AI-based systems are transparent, accountable, and fair to all users.
