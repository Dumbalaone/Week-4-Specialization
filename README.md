# Week-4-Specialization
# AI in Software Engineering – Project Submission

This project covers theoretical analysis, practical implementation, and ethical reflection on applying Artificial Intelligence in Software Engineering workflows.

---

## ✅ Part 1: Theoretical Analysis (30%)

### 1. Short Answer Questions
- **Q1:** Discusses how tools like GitHub Copilot reduce development time and their limitations (e.g., lack of context awareness, security).
- **Q2:** Compares supervised vs. unsupervised learning in bug detection.
- **Q3:** Explains why bias mitigation is critical in personalized UX.

### 2. Case Study Analysis
- Summary of how AIOps automates deployment pipelines to improve speed, error reduction, and efficiency.

---

## ✅ Part 2: Practical Implementation (60%)

### Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion
- Compared Copilot-generated vs manually written Python functions for sorting dictionaries.
- Included code snippets and a 200-word performance analysis.

### Task 2: Automated Testing with AI
- Used Selenium (Python) to automate login test cases (valid/invalid credentials).
- Verified outcomes using assert statements.
- Included screenshot of test results and a 150-word summary explaining AI's impact on test coverage.

### Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation
- Used Breast Cancer dataset (from sklearn) to simulate predicting issue priority (high/low).
- Trained a Random Forest model and evaluated using Accuracy and F1 Score.
- Included Jupyter Notebook and performance metrics file.

---

## ✅ Part 3: Ethical Reflection (10%)

- Discussed potential biases in predictive modeling.
- Proposed use of IBM AI Fairness 360 to detect and mitigate bias.
- Addressed ethical implications in deploying the model in a real-world company.
